                <p class="font-20 font-weight-normal">In wearable devices, what is important is what meaning you give to the acquired data and how you utilize it. We are also interested in whether the acquired data matches the user's experience. Each person's EEG tends to be a little
                    different, and it can also have different meanings depending on the situation you are in. In addition to the EEG data collected by Ear Brain Interface, we combine the user's state and experience data to create a more useful experience.</p>
